I enjoy helping my teammates and learning new tools. In my free time, I like to discover new restaurants with my wife and, of course, to play video games.

## Summary of Experience

With a background in quality assurance, my last few years have been focused on improving application performance, both back-end and front-end, performing stress test on applications and linux operating systems. I develop scripts in shell script, java, javascript, python and go. I plan, manage and troubleshoot virtual cloud machines and container kubernetes, emphasizing on infrastructure automation (Infra as code, always!).
